# Sheypoor frontend-challenge - Milad Hosseinpour

The app is simulate the process of user registration to Sheypoor Newsletter's service.

The `api` directory(module) is completely extra feature for this app, but I wanna show you if we want to have a real API call we need something like that.
And I just select `ofetch` randomlly to show that we can implement this approach with any `API Solutions` like `axios`, `react-query`, etc
