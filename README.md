## Technology Stack

The solution is built with pure TypeScript and uses Parcel as a bundler, which provides simplicity and speed for this project. TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript, which brings powerful type-checking and object-oriented programming capabilities to the language. This choice helps ensure code quality, ease of refactoring, and a more intuitive developer experience.

The `"dependencies"` section of the `package.json` contains `sdk` and `parcel-bundler`. The `sdk` dependency is a local package responsible for providing the necessary functions to interact with the server, while `parcel-bundler` allows us to bundle our TypeScript and other resources in a seamless manner.

The `"devDependencies"` section contains `@babel/core`, `typescript`, `jest` and `ts-jest`. `@babel/core` is used by Parcel under the hood for JavaScript transformations, while `typescript` is used to enable TypeScript features in the project. `jest` is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity and `ts-jest` is a TypeScript preprocessor with source map support for Jest that lets you use Jest to test projects written in TypeScript.

## Deployment

The application is deployed using Netlify and is accessible at [https://master--papaya-travesseiro-566839.netlify.app](https://master--papaya-travesseiro-566839.netlify.app). Netlify provides a streamlined deployment process, allowing us to easily deploy our TypeScript application. Whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of our repository, Netlify automatically rebuilds and deploys our application.

You can find the source code for this project on GitHub at [https://github.com/andishe-wpd/frontend-challenge-pure-ts](https://github.com/andishe-wpd/frontend-challenge-pure-ts).

## Project Structure and Code Explanation

The folder structure is divided into separate files that each manage a specific concern, following a modular architecture. The main file is `app.ts`, which is responsible for the overall flow of the application, using functions from the rest of the project's modules to achieve its requirements.

### Modules

**Navigation module**: This module contains logic related to navigation between different steps of the form. It exports the `navigate` function, which changes the visibility of the different steps based on the argument it receives.

**DOM module**: This module contains utility functions for manipulating the DOM, including getting elements, modifying classes, and getting input values.

**Animation module**: This module is used for managing animations during transitions between steps.

**User module**: This module contains the User interface and `createUser` function. The `createUser` function calls the SDK to create a user on the server and returns the user object and a token.

## Testing

We use Jest and ts-jest for testing our application. Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It works with projects using Babel, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Angular, Vue.js and Svelte.

Each module in our application has an accompanying `.test.ts` file which includes unit tests for the functions exported by the module. For example, `dom.test.ts` includes tests for the functions in the `dom` module.

Our tests ensure that each function behaves as expected under different scenarios. For example, we test that our DOM manipulation functions correctly add, remove, and toggle classes.

To run the tests, use the command `yarn test`.

## User Authentication Process

The authentication process in this application is executed by saving and retrieving user data (tokens and user information) from local storage.

When a user submits their information using the form provided on the second step, these data are sent to the server using the `createUser()` function from the SDK. Once the server confirms the creation of a new user, the application receives a token, which is then stored in local storage together with the user's details.

Here is the relevant section of the code from the `app.ts` file:

tsCopy code

`try { const { user, token } = await createUser(details); localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(user)); localStorage.setItem("token", token); //... } catch (error) { alert("There was an error creating the user"); }`

Local storage in a web application allows the storage of data that persists even after the browser window is closed. Storing the token received from the server in local storage enables the application to "remember" the user's logged-in status between sessions.

In this application, we use the token and user information saved in local storage to automatically log the user in if they are already authenticated. When the application is loaded, it checks whether a token and user information are stored in local storage:

tsCopy code

`const userItem = localStorage.getItem("user"); const tokenItem = localStorage.getItem("token"); if (userItem && tokenItem) { // User is authenticated, load their data }`

If these items exist, it means that the user is authenticated and their details are retrieved and displayed. This helps provide a seamless user experience by eliminating the need for users to log in every time they access the application.

The logout process involves removing these items from local storage:

tsCopy code

`getElement("logout")?.addEventListener("click", () => { localStorage.removeItem("user"); localStorage.removeItem("token"); //... });`

By removing the token and user details, we ensure that the user will need to authenticate again during their next session, thereby logging them out of the application.

### CSS

The CSS for this project is designed to make the form responsive and appealing. It is divided into global styles, form styles, loader styles, and animations. The variables at the top allow easy theming and style changes.

## Why Pure TypeScript

This project was implemented with pure TypeScript to showcase the potential of the language without any frameworks or libraries. This approach has several benefits:

- **Performance**: Without the overhead of a library or framework, the project is lightweight and loads faster.
- **Control**: It provides total control over every aspect of the code, which can sometimes be limited in a framework.
- **Learning**: Writing in pure TypeScript is an excellent exercise to understand the language deeply.

Despite the power of TypeScript, building larger projects without a framework could lead to challenges in managing state and side-effects, where frameworks like React could help. Nonetheless, for this task, TypeScript alone provides all the necessary features.

## Future Plans

Looking forward, we aim to continue improving the code quality, scalability, and developer experience of our project. In line with this goal, we plan to integrate ESLint, Husky, and Prettier into our development workflow.

### ESLint

ESLint is a pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. It helps maintain code quality by catching errors and inconsistencies in our codebase, such as unused variables, missing semicolons, and so on. The flexibility of ESLint allows us to set our coding standards and rules, making it easier to ensure consistency across our project. As the project grows in scale and contributors, ESLint will be an invaluable tool to keep the codebase clean and error-free.

### Husky

Husky is a tool that can prevent bad git commits, pushes, and more üê∂ woof! It simplifies the management of git hooks, making it easier to automate tasks in the git workflow. For instance, we can use Husky to automatically run our ESLint and Jest tests before each commit, ensuring that no failing tests or linter errors make it into our codebase. This reduces the possibility of introducing bugs, enhances code quality, and saves time in code reviews.

### Prettier

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that supports multiple languages and integrates with most editors. It helps to maintain a consistent code style across the project by automatically formatting the code upon saving the file or before committing. This eliminates the need for discussions or debates on code formatting and allows developers to focus on what matters: solving problems and writing great code.

Using these tools in combination can greatly enhance our development workflow. By automating the tasks of linting, testing, and formatting, we can ensure a high-quality, consistent, and bug-free codebase, regardless of the number of developers involved in the project. This approach is necessary for scalability as it simplifies the onboarding process for new developers, reduces code review time, and helps prevent the introduction of bugs or inconsistencies. Therefore, integrating ESLint, Husky, and Prettier into our project is a priority in our future plans.
